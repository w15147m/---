HOW TO BUILD AN APK FOR YOUR PHONE

Since you want to install the app on your personal device, we can build a Release APK.

1. RUN THE BUILD COMMAND
-----------------------
Open a terminal in the root of your project (ReactNativeTutorial) and run:

cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

Note: This might take a few minutes as it compiles everything.

2. LOCATE THE APK
----------------
Once the command finishes successfully, your APK will be created at:

android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
